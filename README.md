# Image-Search-engine


This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for images using the Unsplash API. Users can enter a keyword to search for images, and the application will display the results. There is also a "Show More" button to load additional images.

## Features

- **Image Search:** Users can search for images by entering a keyword.
- **Load More Results:** Users can load more results by clicking the "Show More" button.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
- **External Links:** Each image result links to its source on Unsplash.

## Motivation

I created this project to deepen my understanding of web development, specifically working with APIs and asynchronous JavaScript. By integrating the Unsplash API, I learned how to fetch and display data dynamically based on user input. This project also provided an opportunity to enhance my skills in creating responsive and interactive web applications. Additionally, it serves as a practical tool for anyone looking to quickly find and explore images related to their interests.
